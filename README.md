## Project Overview

This project builds a binary sentiment classifier to categorize Amazon fine food reviews as positive or negative. It demonstrates a complete NLP workflow starting with data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), classical machine learning with TF-IDF and Logistic Regression, and culminating with fine-tuning a state-of-the-art DistilBERT transformer model.

The final model is deployed as an interactive web app with Gradio, allowing users to input text reviews and receive real-time sentiment predictions with confidence scores.

## Dataset

* **Source:** [Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
* **Size:** Over 500,000 reviews
* **Preprocessing:**

  * Removed neutral reviews (rating = 3) to maintain binary sentiment labels
  * Dropped missing values
  * Balanced classes by downsampling the majority class

---

## Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

   * Visualized class distribution and review length distribution
2. **Baseline Model:**

   * Used TF-IDF vectorization (unigrams + bigrams) for text features
   * Trained Logistic Regression classifier
   * Evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC
3. **Transformer Fine-tuning:**

   * Tokenized reviews using DistilBERT tokenizer with truncation and padding
   * Fine-tuned DistilBERT model for binary classification with Hugging Face’s Trainer API
   * Used F1-score as main metric for selecting best model
4. **Evaluation:**

   * Compared classical baseline with DistilBERT performance
   * Visualized results with confusion matrix and ROC curves

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amazon-fine-food-sentiment-analysis.git
cd amazon-fine-food-sentiment-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

* Run data preprocessing and baseline model training notebook/script
* Run DistilBERT fine-tuning notebook/script
* Launch the Gradio app for interactive sentiment prediction:

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

---

## Results

* Baseline Logistic Regression achieved reasonable performance, serving as a strong benchmark.
* Fine-tuned DistilBERT achieved an F1-score of \~0.91 on the validation set, showing significant improvement.
* Model evaluation metrics include classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves — all visualized in the notebooks.

---

## Model Deployment

An interactive Gradio app is included to demonstrate real-time sentiment analysis. Users can enter review text and get immediate predictions with confidence percentages.

---

## Technologies Used

* Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
* scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, evaluation metrics)
* Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets
* Evaluate (metrics computation)
* Gradio (web app deployment)
* Kagglehub (dataset download)

---

## Key Learnings

* Handling large imbalanced text datasets and importance of data preprocessing
* Building strong classical baselines before moving to deep learning
* Fine-tuning transformer models with Hugging Face Trainer API
* Deploying NLP models as user-friendly interactive web apps

---

## Future Work

* Experiment with other transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, etc.)
* Hyperparameter tuning for improved performance
* Incorporate explainability tools like SHAP or LIME
* Extend to multi-class sentiment analysis (adding neutral)
* Deploy as a full web service with backend API
